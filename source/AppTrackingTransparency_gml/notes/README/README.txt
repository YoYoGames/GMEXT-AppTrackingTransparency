Description:
Usually you add this extension because you are using ADs, Analitycs or any other kind of service that
can collect data, so just call AppTrackingTransparency_request() before performing any of those operations.

Extra Configurations:
You can change the NSUserTrackingUsageDescription (text to be used on the popup prompt on iOS device)
by going to: 'Asset Browser -> ext_AppTrackingTransparency -> Extra Platforms -> iOS -> Inject To info.plist'
